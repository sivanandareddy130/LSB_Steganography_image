# LSB_Steganography_image
I am excited to share my project “LSB Image Steganography”, developed during my learning journey with Emertxe Information Technologies. This project focuses on the concept of hiding sensitive information within digital images using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique, a widely used method in steganography.
